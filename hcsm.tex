\section{Higher Courant Sigma Models}

\subsection{Dimension 4}

Relate to R. Szabo's papers....

\subsection{Generalized Dirac Structures}

Nothing too special...a Dirac structure is just a $(n-1)$ Lagrangian in a $n$ symplectic Lie algebroid $E$.  Is there a canonical one? Szabo claims there is for $n=3$. Higher Severa classes.

\ryan{These are different than the $n$-plectic people consider...we want non-degeneracy! So not the same as Zambon or Ikeda's QP manifolds.}

\subsection{Link Invariants}

Same as in the CSM case....
