\subsection{Quantizing Lie-bialgebroids}

Let $E$ be the Courant algebroid determined by the Lie bi-algebroid $(L,L^\vee)$.  Then $L$ itself determines a topological boundary condition. The boundary observables of this theory may be related to the quantum groupoid quantizing $(L, L^\vee)$ as originally described by Ping Xu.
