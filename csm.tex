\section{Courant Sigma Model}


\subsection{Exact Courant Algebroids and the A-model with H-flux}

Exact Courant algebroids are classified by their Severa class $H \in \Omega^3_{cl} (X)$.  Twisting the canonical topological boundary condition via this class may give a description of the $A$-model with $H$-flux $H$. See R. Szabo's work or the JHEP article of Bonechi--Cattaneo--Iraso (\ryan{they get it as a certain gauged fixing for the Poisson sigma model where the Poisson structure is the inverse of a Kahler form}).

\subsection{Dirac Structures}

Claim: For fixed $E$, topological boundary conditions (on the target) are given precisely by Dirac structures. 


\subsection{Link Invariants}

Let $E$ be a Courant algebroid and $R$ a representation up to homotopy of the associated 2-symplectic Lie algebroid.  Further, assume that $R$ is equipped with an invariant trace.  Wilson loop observables determine invariants for links in a 3-manifold source manifold (anomalies?).
